# npx Business Card

Hi, I’m Jamie McNeil – Software Engineer, Tech Lead, and builder of cool things. I wanted a fun and modern way to share my professional details, so I created this interactive terminal business card.

Run a single command, and my info will appear right in your terminal – clean, simple, and just a bit geeky.

### 📦 Installation

Installation is not required! You can run this package with npx.

👇 _Easy Peasy_

```bash
npx jamiemcneil
```
